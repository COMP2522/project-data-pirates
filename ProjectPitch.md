Introduction: Our project aims to create an exciting single-player video game where the player must survive against multiple enemies and defend themselves in a limited time. The player will have the opportunity to collect random weapons scattered throughout the map to help them in their survival journey.

Problem Statement: The challenge in this project lies in efficiently organizing and coordinating different objects and classes.

Solution: To overcome this challenge, we will use UML to design the structure of the game and effectively organize the objects and classes using Java Object Oriented programming.

Benefits: This project will provide an opportunity for an integrative practice of Java programming, improving the members' understanding of class concepts.

Methodology: We will use UML and Java Object Oriented programming to design and develop the game.

Timeline: A detailed timeline with key milestones and deadlines will be created after careful planning and analysis.

Budget: As this is a practice project, there will be no commercial budget involved, and the estimated cost is zero.

Risks and Challenges: Potential risks include the possibility of design similarity, which we will mitigate by ensuring originality in our approach.

Conclusion: Our project will provide an exciting and challenging experience for players and an integrative practice of Java programming for the members involved. The key features of the game include survival against multiple enemies, a limited time frame, and the ability to collect weapons for defense.
